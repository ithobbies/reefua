## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep-sea blue (#004B7F), reminiscent of the ocean depths, forms the base of the UI, symbolizing stability and depth.
- Background color: Light desaturated blue (#E0F0F8) provides a clean, spacious feel, complementing the primary blue without overwhelming the design.
- Accent color: Coral-orange (#FF715B), used sparingly for highlights and interactive elements, mimicking vibrant coral reefs.
- Headings font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern look.
- Body font: 'Manrope' (sans-serif), with support for Ukrainian glyphs.
- Font sizes: Headings at 32/24/18 px, body at 14 px; semibold for prices, weight used sparingly to highlight prices.
- Rounded cards (12px radius) for a soft, modern feel. Glassmorphism headers for a sleek, semi-transparent look.
